            <h4>FTC Website Redesign</h4>
            <p>This project was designed to rethink and redesign a federal agencies website. A goal of this project was to better highlight the useful resources the FTC had to offer for consumers and businesses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Based on 16 user interviews and multiple surveys this site went through 8 different 
                    design iterations to arrive at the final high 
                    fidelity prototype.</p></li>
                <li><p>This was achieved by creating a tabbed structure that allows the user to navigate 
                    and filter the site based on their background 
                    (government, consumer, or business).</p></li>
                <li><p>Tools: Adobe XD and Affinity Designer</p></li>

            <h4>Group Travel App - TGTHR</h4>
            <p>This app was developed as a new and unique travel mobile application. After interviews and industry research the niche chosen was to address the struggle of planning travel with a group. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Competitor analysis was crucial in this development; identified helpful features and avoided filler content.</p></li>
                <li><p>A creative solution within this app is the anonymous polling feature developed from user insights. Users can receive honest feedback without their companions editing their answers to appease  social pressure.</p></li>
